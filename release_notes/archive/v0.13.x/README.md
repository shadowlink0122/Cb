## Development Timeline

| Version | Date | Focus |
|---------|------|-------|
| v0.13.1 (original) | Nov 16, 2025 | Async impl methods |
| v0.13.2 | Nov 16, 2025 | Generic array fixes |
| v0.13.3 | Nov 16, 2025 | Documentation |

| **v0.13.1 (unified)** | **Nov 16, 2025** | **All of the above** |

## Reason for Consolidation

The incremental versions (v0.13.1-v0.13.4) were developed in rapid succession over 2 days as part of a cohesive effort to complete the v0.13.x feature set. Rather than releasing them as separate versions, they were consolidated into a single v0.13.1 release for:

1. **Clarity**: Users see one comprehensive release instead of four incremental ones
2. **Testing**: All features were tested together as a unit
3. **Stability**: The consolidated release represents a stable, fully-tested milestone

## Reference

For the complete feature set and all changes, please refer to the unified release notes at `release_notes/v0.13.1.md`.
